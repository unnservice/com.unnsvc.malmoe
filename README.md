# Description
Supplemental software for [Rhena](https://github.com/unnservice/com.unnsvc.rhena)

# Rationale
Rhena requires a repository manager to fully leverage the dependency resolution capabilities. Project Malmoe is one implementation of such a repository manager in the form of a web application so that it can perform proxying and caching of dependency artifacts, it can also resolve maven artifacts as rhena dependency chains.
